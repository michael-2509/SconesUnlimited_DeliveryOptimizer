# SconesUnlimited Vehicle Classifier

Welcome to the **SconesUnlimited Vehicle Classifier** project! ðŸŽ‰ This repository showcases my work as part of my Udacity Nano Degree Machine Learning course The goal of this project is to build and deploy an image classification model to identify delivery vehicles, optimizing routing and operations.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've developed an image classification model that differentiates between bicycles and motorcycles. This model is designed to improve the efficiency of delivery routing, ensuring that bicycles are assigned to nearby orders and motorcyclists to more distant ones. The end result is a more streamlined delivery process that helps Scones Unlimited enhance their logistics operations.

### Key Features:

- **Image Classification Model:** A model that classifies delivery vehicles as bicycles or motorcycles.
- **AWS Integration:** Leveraged AWS Sagemaker for model training and deployment.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Used AWS Lambda functions to handle real-time predictions and data processing.
- **Event-Driven Workflow:** Orchestrated with AWS Step Functions for a scalable and reliable solution.
